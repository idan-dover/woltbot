# Hi there 
I am a simple python program to run a telegram bot that gives me data about restaurants from wolt

## How to create a telegram bot 

- Enter telegram and start a chat with BotFather
- Send a "/start" message and follow his rules
- After you chose the name and user name of your bot, you will receive bot token. Save it securely

- Create a .env file and copy the text from .env.local file. After that put the bot token in the value of "BOT_API_KEY"
- Download required packages: "python-telegram-bot", "python-dotenv", "requests"
- Run python3 main.py
- Enjoy :)
